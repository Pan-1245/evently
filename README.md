# üìå Evently

Evently is a practice project built with Go, designed to explore and demonstrate the application of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Clean Architecture in a microservices context.

This example includes multiple services (e.g., booking, user) with a clear separation of concerns across domain, application, and infrastructure layers. It serves as a reference for structuring Go microservices in a clean, maintainable, and scalable way.

üîç Key Concepts Practiced

- üß± Clean Architecture layering
- üí° DDD principles including aggregates, entities, and bounded contexts
- üîå RESTful inter-service communication (no shared DBs, no gRPC)
- üß™ In-memory and PostgreSQL repository patterns
- üõ†Ô∏è Interface-driven design with testability in mind

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is not production-ready. It‚Äôs intended for educational and architectural exploration purposes only.
